            <p If you've made it this far that means you completed the short
                and hopefully fun questions about me. My name is Eric although
                many people call me E or Bygg E for short. I was born and raised
                in Memphis,TN and attended East High where I'm an alumni. Earned 
                several athletic scholarships to a number of Division 1 colleges.
                I chose to attend University of Cincinnati where Psychology was 
                my major with a minor in Biology. After college I held a series of
                jobs ranging from a clothing retailer to a compounding engineer. 
                Gaining forklift certification to operate any type and brand of
                forklift. My goals are fairly simple, well for me they are.
                Continue to add to my skill set which covers all areas of my life.
                With the knowlege that I've gained and continue to gain I want to 
                help build my community to better than what it ever was, build my own
                business empire, and to leave all that I've earned to my children.
                A legacy that not even my wildest imagination could conjure up.></p>
