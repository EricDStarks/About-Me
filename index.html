            <p> If you've made it this far that means you completed the short</p>
            <p> and hopefully fun questions about me. My name is Eric although</p>
            <p> many people call me E or Bygg E for short. I was born and raised</p>
            <p> in Memphis,TN and attended East High where I'm an alumni. Earned</p> 
            <p> several athletic scholarships to a number of Division 1 colleges.</p>
            <p> I chose to attend University of Cincinnati where Psychology was</p> 
            <p> my major with a minor in Biology. After college I held a series of</p>
            <p> jobs ranging from a clothing retailer to a compounding engineer.</p> 
            <p> Gaining forklift certification to operate any type and brand of</p>
            <p> forklift. My goals are fairly simple, well for me they are.</p>
            <p> Continue to add to my skill set which covers all areas of my life.</p>
            <p> With the knowlege that I've gained and continue to gain I want to</p> 
            <p> help build my community to better than what it ever was, build my own</p>
            <p> business empire, and to leave all that I've earned to my children.</p>
            <p> A legacy that not even my wildest imagination could conjure up.</p>
